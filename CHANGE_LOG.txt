02-05-2022:
* Add keywords to grammar file (BabyCobolTokens.g4)
* Copy grammar from original BabyCobol paper (BabyCobolGrammar.g4)
* Extend original grammar with divisions & paragraphs

-> Achieved: Simple parsing of the fib example files as given in the paper. Doesn't parse completely yet.

03-05-2022:
* Work on identification division
-> Encountered problem with the greedy algorithm. Always matches ~[.]+ with everything, not just the identification division.
   -> A possible solution is to switch to a non-greedy strategy (https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/wildcard.md)
      -> Eventually not necessary, but switched to a recursive grammar rule, which switches between arbitrary values.
         Really not a nice implementation but it works.

* Add support for quantification (FOR)
* Ability to fully parse (without any errors) the simple fib file.
* Add labels to grammar rules with multiple RHSs.
* Started working on a quick-and-dirty pretty-print program.
-> Is able to expand picture representations to their proper values 2(X) -> XX and 99V9(9) -> 99V999999999
-> For the visual effect sequence numbers are printed in the first six columns.
-> Depth values for the data division are recalculated and increase by one each depth.
   -> Not properly done yet... Currently the following problem persists:
      000000 IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
      000001     PROGRAMID. TEST-REPRESENTATION.
      000002 DATA DIVISION.
      000003     1 TEST PICTURE IS 9XXXXX999.
      000004         2 BETA LIKE TEST.
      000005     1 OMEGA OCCURS 20 TIMES.
      000006             3 ALPHA PICTURE IS AAAXXXXX9.
      But 3 ALPHA ... should be one indent back, starting on the same column as 2 BETA ...

04-05-2022:
* Update the ANTLR grammar to what's available on the BabyCobol documentation site, since the paper has some mistakes
* Set new goal: Implement a pre-processor that conducts the full lexical analysis.
-> Attempted to write an ANTLR grammar, but for now switched to Java regex.

05-05-2022:
* Continued on column based parsing.
-> Base regex on the COBOL preprocessor as found on the ANTLR GitHub (https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/c270f16dc0bc30fb15f7b1aac1d2239f8512d704/cobol85/java/CobolPreprocessor.java#L34)

06-05-2022:
* Continued on column based parsing
-> Start working on inserting continued lines in the same line.
-> Finished column based parsing in the Java preprocessor.

09-06-2022:
* The preprocessor will communicate line numbers after the 72nd column with the sequence #![S]_[E]\r\n
-> Where S -> First line number of the line and E -> Last number of the line (in case of line merges)
-> Started on a custom error listener that shows correct line numbers and underlines errors.

* By including the Line objects in the error listener, we do not have to provide the original line numbers in the to be parsed text.
* Give a warning when the clean printing removes information from the A section

* Found a section in the ANTLR reference p. 210 about keywords not being reserved.

12-06-2022:
* Start on implementing "keywords as identifiers" according to p. 210.
-> Looks easy since it's just adding all keywords to the identifier rule, however. How do we fix the issue of ambiguity?
   Since ANTLR chooses for us right?

* Move atomic expressions out of normal statements.
* PROBLEM: How do we tell the parser to choose depending on the case?!

* White space insignificance
-> Tried to split tokens into subtokens consisting out of single letters, didn't work. Whitespace still affected
   tokenization.
-> Put separate single char tokens as grammar rules.
   -> This works great! Only have to figure out on how to handle the picture repr. and integers.
   -> Integers should have been fixed

16-05-2022:
* Started on using predicates in order to distinguish keywords from identifiers.
* Well, eventually decided to switch back, since during the parsing one cannot get the value of a gramamr rule on the
  right-hand-side, since this can still be anything. (Yield a class casting error)

17-05-2022:
* Possibly came up with a fix for yesterday's issue. So instead of redefining every token as a grammar rule consisting
  out of separate tokens we are back at actual tokens. However, they are built up from individual character fragments
  that are non-greedily followed by whitespace.
  -> This especially took a lot of effort, since everything was being recognized as names, this was fixed by making sure
     that all the individual fragments have a non-greedy consumption of possible whitespace.
  -> It should now be possible to use predicates in order to check if the parser should detect the keyword or tell that
     it is an identifier.

18-05-2022:
* While testing the parser I figured out that ANTLR shows all the places where ambiguity takes place. Perhaps there are
  triggers fired during parsing upon which we could act.
* Start focussing on one thing at the time, for now do not continue on white-space ignorance. But first focus on having
  the option to have keywords as identifiers.
* Just discovered that ambiguities are apparently reported!!! And can be dealt with in the error listener!!!
* Ambiguities are indeed DETECTED, but cannot be changed with the reportAmbiguity() function as declared in the
  BaseErrorListener.

19-05-2022:
* New idea, we can apparently not get the proper input in a predicate of a grammar rule before deciding things.
  However, if a predicate decides to fail afterwards, we can handle accordingly.
  -> Yeah handling things afterwards in this manner doesn't seem the best option.
* Perhaps now take a look at having the ability to use error recovery?!
* Since I am quite stuck, for now wait till I get the repositories from Vadim and start focussing on something else.

23-05-2022:
* Start on sufficient qualification.
* Finished the data structure that holds all variables according to the given order and levels.
* Created a tree visitor that collects the variables into the previously made data structure.

24-05-2022:
* Validate the quantification in the procedure division. Give error messages and warnings when appropriate.

25-05-2022:
* Finally received the ANTLR projects from Vadim.
  -> All of them have not implemented the keywords == identifiers feature.
  -> Some of them have limited whitespace ignorance between tokens but not within them.
     -> Hence that feature isn't implemented either since one just does WS: [ ] -> skip;
* Conclusion: Perhaps a better idea to just let the idea die for now and focus on other features!
  -> We can of course still describe the idea in the paper, and where the journey has ended.
  -> TODO: Message Vadim on what to do, for now continue with sufficient qualification
* Got answer back during the meeting on what would happen with the example:

000001 ...
000002 PROCEDURE DIVISION.
000003     DISPLAY A.
000004   X.
000005     DISPLAY B.

Where X is parsed as a label "X" and not skipped over or parsed as "  X"

27-05-2022:
* Finished sufficient qualification.
* Continue on writing a pre-processor in ANTLR.
