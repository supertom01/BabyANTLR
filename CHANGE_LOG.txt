* Add keywords to grammar file (BabyCobolTokens.g4)
* Copy grammar from original BabyCobol paper (BabyCobolGrammar.g4)
* Extend original grammar with divisions & paragraphs

-> Achieved: Simple parsing of the fib example files as given in the paper. Doesn't parse completely yet.

03-05-2022:
* Work on identification division
-> Encountered problem with the greedy algorithm. Always matches ~[.]+ with everything, not just the identification division.
   -> A possible solution is to switch to a non-greedy strategy (https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/wildcard.md)
      -> Eventually not necessary, but switched to a recursive grammar rule, which switches between arbitrary values.
         Really not a nice implementation but it works.

* Add support for quantification (FOR)
* Ability to fully parse (without any errors) the simple fib file.
