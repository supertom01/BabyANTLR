           10 SECTION-1.
             15 A.
               16 B PICTURE IS XX(2)V-9.
             11 B.
               12 Z.
                 20 U PICTURE IS 9(4)V99.
      * Is the line below allowed? Or does this cause an infinite loop?
      *          13 C LIKE Z.
                 13 C LIKE SECTION-1.
           10 SECTION-2.
             15 U PICTURE IS XX.
             15 X OCCURS 20 TIMES.
             15 Y.
      * Should work, since it points to a direct child "B" of "SECTION-1"
               16 S LIKE B OF SECTION-1.
               16 Z LIKE B OF A OF SECTION-1.
               16 W LIKE U OF SECTION-2.
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       MAIN.
      * Should work since B is only once defined as a field. (Containers cannot be used in expressions)
           DISPLAY B.
      * Will not work. C is perhaps defined once, but S copies section-1.
           DISPLAY C.
      * Should work since U is uniquely referenced by indicating that it has to be taken from section-1.
           DISPLAY U OF SECTION-1.
      * The compiler should figure out that B is now a container, containing the variable U.
           DISPLAY U OF B.
           DISPLAY U OF Z OF B OF SECTION-1.
           DISPLAY U OF SECTION-2.
      * The line "A LIKE B OF SECTION-1." should allow the following:
           DISPLAY U OF Z OF S OF Y OF SECTION-2.
           DISPLAY U OF Y.
